Within : Without is a work in which two slide projectors projected the slides
in sequence onto the same projection area. The first slide is seen alone for
eighteen seconds before the next slide is projected over the already existing
image. This results in a superimposition of two views that lasts for six
seconds before the first image disappears slowly and the next one can be seen
alone for another eighteen seconds before the next superimposition occurs.
Thirty-nine images are shown in this rhythm, offering the viewers a
rhythmically flowing tour of Rudolph Schindlerâ€™s How House. The slide show is
conceived as a loop.
