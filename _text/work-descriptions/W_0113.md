CityCenter was a temporary installation shown at the Arts Center Project Space in Abu Dhabi. Six silver window blinds were suspended from the ceiling and extended down to the floor to form a hexagonal column. The piece was included in the group exhibition Plastic Fantastic, curated by Felix Beck in connection with the symposium “Precious Plastic WANA” at New York University Abu Dhabi.
