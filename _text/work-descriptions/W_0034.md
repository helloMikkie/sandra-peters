Like *Bilateral—Diagonal* (2011), the installation *Borrowed Window Piece I* is one of the works whose primary point of reference is the architecture of Rudolph Schindler. I developed the installation with the Kunstsæle exhibition space in Berlin in mind, although it is not, strictly speaking, site-specific. *Borrowed Window Piece I* is one of two window designs inspired by my stay in Los Angeles, in the spring of 2011. The window for the exhibition at Kunstsæle is based on a window configuration at Schindler’s Lechner House in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, completed in 1948.
