Created for a private collector, the light installation Corner Piece was designed with her living room in mind: five semicircular elements were mounted in one corner of the room, spaced at regular intervals from the floor up to the ceiling. The elements were made of medium-density fiberboard, painted a matt white, and equipped with two neon tubes each that emitted a dimmable white light. The work was destroyed in 2012.
