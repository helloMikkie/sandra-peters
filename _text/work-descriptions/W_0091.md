In Green, in Line, in Pairs : Eleven Double Structuresâ€”Unfolding the Cube is a design for a neon-light installation. It is based on the eleven nets of the cube. Each net is paired with an identical net in a double structure composed of neon tubes that emit green light. The eleven double structures are mounted on the walls of the exhibition architecture, with their bottom horizontal lines aligned at the same height. The work can be executed in a variety of indoor or outdoor settings, always in interaction with the architectonic situation.
