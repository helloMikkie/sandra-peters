The title *DRIVE* is directly related to the multifaceted experience that the player has with my mini-golf hole. The person playing the hole needs to gently throw (with their hands) the ball onto the curvy lane and try to steer the ball into the hole. While balancing the ball on the lane, the player will have various experiences: one is the soundscape that the ball creates while rolling across the lane; the second one is that the player will face the difficulty of finding the right balance to push the ball into the hole with the correct momentum. The lane has no boundaries and the ball can easily get off track and fall off the lane, especially if the player plays with too much speed. It is possible to get the ball into the hole, but the player must proceed calmly and with caution, and success requires some patience.
