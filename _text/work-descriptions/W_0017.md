The art project *Modification—Constantly Climbing Stones* was a site-sensitive installation in the exhibition space of Kunstverein Ruhr in Essen. Two load-bearing pillars with square cross-sections were walled in with two different helical brick bonds. The bond patterns were a reference to the chimneys of Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam. The intended effect was aesthetic: the brickwork structures seemed to pierce the floor and ceiling in an infinite helical motion. They also engaged the gallery’s surroundings, visible through the generously sized window, in dialogue. The two brick-built columns are designed to be suitable for exhibition in a variety of spaces; depending on the particulars of the site, each realization is a new work.
