The neon wall piece Elemente als Formen, Formen als Elemente was my first major wall-mounted work; I realized it for the exhibition Zeichnung heute V at Kunstmuseum Bonn (2007). It consists of nine neon elements of varying dimensions, between 1.6 and 2.2 meters tall and .2 and 1.4 meters wide. Taken together, they occupy about 8 meters of wall space. Mounted roughly at eye level, they allow the beholder to stand, as it were, “inside” the work without being overwhelmed by it. For the neon elements, I chose the narrowest available tubing with a diameter of 10 millimeters, so that the wall piece can also be read as a drawing. I generated the formal vocabulary for Elemente als Formen, Formen als Elemente from the configurations of forms in the drawings in the Rheinland series, which was also on view in the exhibition in Bonn.
