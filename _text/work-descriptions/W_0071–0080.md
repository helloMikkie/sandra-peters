I started taking photographs of puddles in urban landscapes in 2013. The first pictures, taken in Berlin, date from the spring of 2013. In the summer of 2014, I photographed puddles in Vienna. The series now also encompasses frozen-over puddles (2015), slush puddles during a thaw (2015), puddles in Paris (2016), and, although it hardly ever rains there, puddles in Abu Dhabi (2015/16). The puddles reflect the cities and nature around them. Puddles are ephemeral, mirror images fixed in photographs.

The pictures in the series are framed in a variety of ways: sets of three by three and four by four photographs, pairs, and individually framed pictures. The latter vary in size. Set in their diverse frames, they are presented in a scattershot arrangement on the wall, not unlike the way puddles will appear here and there on the ground.
