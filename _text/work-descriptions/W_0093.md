On the Move—In Circles consists of color silkscreen prints on sixteen glass panes (42 × 56.9 cm each, thickness .4 cm). Each pane is printed in three colors, one on the reverse and two on the obverse side. The prints explore the motif of overlapping circular forms. A template divided into twelve segments served as a matrix to determine the points where the resulting crescent-shaped segments converge and diverge. The circle was taken to represent an octave. All circular configurations rotate relative to one another in the sequence of the printed glass panes. Depending on which circular configuration on the obverse side was printed first and which was printed last, the eight panes each accentuate the minor or major modes in music. They are distinguishable by the colors: the circle printed on the reverse side of the glass is  coral red (major) or beige (minor).

The idea for the glass piece arose in 2010/16, as I was working with four associates to develop the sound piece linked to the installation Modification—constantly climbing stones. I made drawings to illustrate to the team how I wanted the helical motion of the brick columns to be translated into an acoustic experience. The resulting sound installation, Sound Column : Circling Sound, grew out of the transposition of an architectural (columns) into a tonal structure and acoustic situation; in On the Move—In Circles, by contrast, I visualized an acoustic experience imparted by the sound installation.
