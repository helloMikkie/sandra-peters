Webbing is a site-sensitive installation. It consists of six cubes suspended from the ceiling that are aligned at right angles to each other but not to the surrounding architecture. The six faces of each cube (105 × 105 cm) are suspended by thin wire cables from a square wooden frame (edge length 140 cm), which in turn hangs from the ceiling by wire cables. Each face of each cube consists of the same bilateral-diagonal grid structure, painted a matt white, whereas the larger wooden frames are left unpainted. The wire cables allow the faces of the cubes and the frames to sway relative to each other. Depending on the dimensions of the room, the cubes may be hung at smaller or larger distances, but always roughly at eye level for adult viewers, allowing them to perceive their own bodies in relation to them. The configuration of the bilateral-diagonal structures of the faces and their diagonal axes is different in each cube. Visual superimpositions and compactions result; the cubes seem to dovetail in ways that engender intricate structures in the viewer’s perception.
