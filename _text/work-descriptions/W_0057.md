The cube Interface No. 1 was first on public display at Aanant & Zoo, Berlin, in 2012. It was installed in the second gallery, the central one of three rooms, face to face with the wall drawing (Corner Piece / Interface 1), which showed the net of the cube. Spread out over two adjacent walls set at a right angle to each other, the drawing effectively implemented the first step in folding up the net into a cube.
