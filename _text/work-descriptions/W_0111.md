To celebrate the release of the monograph PER/TRANS. Performing the Cube, Transforming the Cube. Works by Sandra Peters 1998–2017, a book party was held at the bookstore Motto in Berlin, in the summer of 2018. The store is set in a backyard in Kreuzberg. Glass display cases line the driveway and the courtyard outside the store. To announce the book presentation, I made four large-format posters for the display cases showing several of my works: Pandora’s Box (2016), Untitled (Blaue Blume) (2018), Zabriskie Point (2013), and the installation Webbing (2015). The presentation was held in front of the display cases with my designs.
