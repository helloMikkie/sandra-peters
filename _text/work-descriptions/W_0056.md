Based on the idea of exhibiting the cube in isolation, I worked on a design for a presentation of six different cubes as an ensemble in an interior or exterior setting. The cubes differ in terms of the allocation of the bilateral-diagonal structure to the six faces. They are to be arranged in two staggered rows of three cubes each and set at an angle of 45 degrees relative to the axes of the rows. The beholder can walk around each cube and sample a variety of perspectives. He or she can choose to view the cubes as an ensemble from a distance or meander between them. To try out different permutations, I built models on a scale of 1:10. They allow me to test the possible permutations in allocating the bilateral-diagonal structure to the individual cubes as well as their arrangements in space.
