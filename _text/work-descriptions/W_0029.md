As the installation Modificationâ€”Constantly Climbing Stones was being built, the idea arose of translating the columns into a tonal structure. The mathematician Stefan Sechelmann, the sound artist Masayuki Ren, and the art historian Gregor Stemmrich contributed to the realization of this idea. The drawing Untitled (Sound Column : Circling Sound) visualizes the rhythm that Stemmrich developed, which served as the underlying structure of the sound piece. I worked with the graphic designer Julia Fuchs to render that rhythm in a drawing.
