*Los Angeles,* a series of collaged drawings, is the result of my aesthetic reflections on the city of Los Angeles. I assembled diverse foils and sheets of paper and subjected them to graphic redaction. In a series of three steps, I combined different elements in a collage-like fashion and then reworked them: I integrated photocopied details of a first set of drawings into a second set, segments of which I then inserted into a third set by montaging them in new configurations of papers and foils. The drawings are based on individual elements sewn together and treated in a variety of techniques. Sewing allowed me to consolidate the diverse papers and foils into durable assemblages. The drawings were intended as prototypes for large wall-based works, though the latter have yet to be realized. As drawings, these “drafts” retain their autonomous character.
