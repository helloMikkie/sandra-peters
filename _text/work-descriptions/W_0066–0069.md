Untitled (Facade Studies II) is a series of five collaged drawings inspired by Rudolph Schindler’s residence at 835 North Kings Road, West Hollywood (1922), and more specifically by the building’s facade structure. The drawings are composed of sheets of cardboard silkscreen printed in different matt colors as well as foils and transparent papers. They reflect and recreate the rhythm and specific materiality of the various components of the original structure. The drawings are presented side by side on a table.
