My unrealized installation Borrowed Window Piece II was conceived with the yoga and exhibition space Y8 in Hamburg in mind. Taking the proportions of the room into account, I designed two windows that would act as room dividers of a sort. I also planned to hang a panel of white fabric from the ceiling at some distance from the larger window, as a kind of curtain. The three elements were meant to alter the existing structure of the space, engendering layered visual planes that the studioâ€™s clients would have been free to walk among for a modulated perception of interior and exterior spaces.
