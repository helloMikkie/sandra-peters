Bilateral—Diagonal was a large drawing I conceived for my exhibition at the yoga and exhibition space Y8 in Hamburg. It is related to the object Untitled, which I made out of wood laths of different lengths (uniform cross-section of 2 × 2 cm). Measuring 100 × 100 cm and painted white, it represents the bilateral structure. In the gallery, I mounted this object on a white wall, into which it seemed to recede. The large-format drawing on the floor corresponded to the comparatively small sculpture on the wall; in a reading of the work based on conventional correlations, the resulting impression was one of chiastic inversion.
