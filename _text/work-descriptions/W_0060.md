In North Kings Road // Intricate Structure, I explored Rudolph and Pauline Schindler’s experimentation with social interaction at the Kings Road House. Rudolph Schindler, in consultation with Pauline, designed four workrooms of equal value, for both the male and female residents of the house, as a prerequisite for communal living. At the same time, he shifted the living rooms to play with outdoor space in a way that negotiated both public and private life. The traditional hierarchical order of the nuclear family as a social unit is broken open by Schindler’s design. With this architectonic structure, he encouraged a different encounter between the self and one’s surroundings. In the process, he created a spatial situation that rewrites the typical distribution of gender roles in society and encourages nonhierarchical action in relation to others.
