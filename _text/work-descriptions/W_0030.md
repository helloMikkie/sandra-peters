Flux Balance / Rotating Wings begins with exterior views of the Schindler House and its grounds. A cross-fade to a concrete wall with window slits then guides the viewer into the building’s interior. Based on the rotating ground plan, the projection, which runs for just under fifteen minutes, pursues a tour of Schindler’s architecture and the gardens. Slowly fading into each other, the images instill a sense of the flow experienced by the visitor walking through the building itself. The superimposition of two views either reflects the dynamic balance of Schindler’s architecture or, where interior views blend into exterior shots, examines the materiality of the architectonic barrier. Just as the walls interact with both interior and exterior spaces by virtue of their material facture, the cross-fade marks the boundary where interior fades into exterior.
