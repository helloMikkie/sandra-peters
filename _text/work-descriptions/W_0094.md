A cube can be unfolded in different ways, yielding eleven nets. These nets serve as the basis for the sculpture Pandoraâ€™s Box. The elements of the sculpture are eleven half-unfolded aluminum cubes that are also sculptures in themselves. Ten of them are powder-coated in yellow; one is powder-coated in a shimmering dark grey. The sculptures are designed to be set out throughout the exhibition space. The placement is part of the work. It stresses both the impression of a spatial field and the impression of a kinetic energy coursing through that field. To this end, some of the cubes may be placed in groups of two or three, while others may stand apart. It is important to notice that the cubes may be set on any one of their sides, which significantly changes their appearance. Over the course of an exhibition, the cubes will change positions and be grouped with others near them in the exhibition space, becoming nomadic objects that will travel through the space.
