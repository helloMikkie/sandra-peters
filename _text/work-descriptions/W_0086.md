In Untitled (Wandering Spirit), each of the six sides of a cube is a separate bilateral­diagonal grid structure that can be oriented in eight different ways. The sides are individually suspended by thin wire cables from a wooden support structure that in turn hangs from the ceiling by thin wire cables. The free-floating cube is hung at the viewer’s eye level.
