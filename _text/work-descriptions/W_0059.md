To date, North Kings Road // Intricate Structure exists only as a concept, design drawing, and model. It is the plan for an exhibition inspired by the Schindler House (now the MAK Center for Art and Architecture), a residence on North Kings Road, Los Angeles, completed in 1922. In 2012, Kimberli Meyer, the MAK’s director, invited me to participate in the project “Schindler Lab” and contribute an exhibition design. North Kings Road // Intricate Structure was included in the online publication Schindler Lab.
