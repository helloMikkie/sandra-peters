The neon lettering tango, created in collaboration with cyan, Berlin, consists of five individual lowercase characters. Contrasting with the geometric rigidity of the glass shapes resting on the floor, the typography is defined by bulging lines that readily bring to mind a diagram illustrating the steps of a dance. The glass panes reflect the architecture of the exhibition space, with those closest to the letters also mirroring the neon light. As the visitors move through the field, their images appear in the mirroring glass surfaces as well. The reflection of their movements heightens the impression of the workâ€™s fluid existence in the room.
