Ahoy is different from the other two slide projections in that it consists exclusively of exterior shots of the building. During a stay in California, in the spring of 2012, I drove to the Lovell Beach House a total of four times, always at a different time of day, to take photographs in various lighting situations of the facade views to which I had access.

Researching the Lovell Beach House, I came across photographs that Schindler himself had taken during its construction and soon after its completion. Some of these historic shots are included in Ahoy. Instead of superimposing spaces, as in the projections of the How House and the residence on North Kings Road, Ahoy imparts the experience of a temporal displacement: the viewer can observe how the client and the building’s inhabitants modified Schindler’s original design over the years to suit their needs. Conspicuously, the Lovell Beach House was an isolated structure when completed in 1926; the surrounding area was undeveloped. Now it is embedded in a densely populated urban landscape.

The flow of the slides in Ahoy presents various views of the house, forming a portrait that interweaves its current situation with selected flashbacks and views of the building as originally realized by Schindler.
