For the new headquarters of the Federal Intelligence Service (BND) on Berlin’s Chausseestraße, I conceived four similar but not identical sculptural objects. With shapes rounded on all sides, they were to look like boulders. Yet this impression would have been contradicted by their size, materiality, and appearance: they were to be made of steel and coated with translucent paint.

To illustrate the idea for this outdoor sculpture, I made a model, captured it in photographs, and collaged the pictures into a design drawing of the project.
