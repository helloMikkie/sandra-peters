The wall drawing Untitled (Butterfly Effect) was an adaptation of a drawing from Rheinland (2005â€“2007), a series of collaged drawings, each with two sheets of transparent paper mounted on it, that show abstract versions of natural forms. They were inspired by butterfly wings in the collection of the Zoological Research Museum Alexander Koenig in Bonn. The wall drawing Untitled (Butterfly Effect) was an attempt to devise another form of abstraction from creative engagement with the found natural forms.

In 2007, the drawing series Rheinland was presented at Kunstmuseum Bonn; the wall drawing was concurrently on view in a group exhibition at Atelierhaus Bonn.
