Schindler built the How House in 1925 for James Eads How. It stands on a parcel of rugged land that is almost level along the street but slopes down toward a rocky ravine at the far end. Schindler adapted the How House to the site: the back section of the building descends toward the ravine in a series of tiers. For the part of the building set on the slope, Schindler primarily used concrete, whose structure and color harmonize with the stony terrain; wood (California redwood) predominates in the front part of the building.

Running for just under twelve minutes, the slide projection Within : Without opens with exterior shots of the How House and its grounds. A cross-fade eventually leads to the lateral living-room window and then into the building’s interior; based on the building’s bilateral-diagonal ground plan, the work presents a tour of Schindler’s architecture as well as the adjoining garden.
