Zabriskie Point is an exhibition project in which sixty-six concrete sculptures are to be placed in an interior or exterior space. The viewers will stand in an installation that will extend like a field around them.

Each of the sixty-six sculptures is composed of two elements. The individual elements consist of the eleven different nets of the cube. They are combined to form sixty-six different pairs. The number of pairs is based on the fact that each of the eleven elements is combined with any other, plus the eleven pairs in which an element forms a pair with itself. The size of the concrete sculptures varies according to the space available for the installation. Another part of Zabriskie Point is a still from the eponymous film by Michelangelo Antonioni (1970). The film still is a black-and-white “found image” that was scanned and then printed on newsprint. The paper is very light-sensitive and will change color in the foreseeable future.
