Pair is a neon light installation realized for a private collection. It is based on one of the eleven possible ways of unfolding the cube. The selected net is paired with an identical second net in a double structure made of neon tubes that emit a warm white light. The double structure is mounted on the walls of the entrance hall of the collectorâ€™s home.
