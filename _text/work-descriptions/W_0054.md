Interface No. 1 takes the form of a cube whose faces are formed by parallel struts set at right angles to one another, based on a grid of eight by eight fields. The struts effect a diagonal segmentation of the face. Gaps between them allow the beholder to peer through the cube. The first strut, abutting one edge, spans the full width of the face, and so the next one, which braces it at a right angle, does not have the same length. The ratio of lengths is 8:7, followed by 7:6, 6:5, 5:4, 4:3, 3:2, 2:1, and 1:0. The diagonal sequence of abutting struts is accordingly staggered to one side. Still, the stepped corners are precisely aligned with the diagonal of the square face. Interface No. 1 can be presented indoors or outdoors. The work is not site-specific.
