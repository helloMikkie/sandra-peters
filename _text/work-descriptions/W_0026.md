In 2009, the artist Karin Sander curated the exhibition Zeigen. An Audio Tour through Berlin for Temporäre Kunsthalle, a short-lived exhibition space that existed in Berlin’s Mitte district from 2008 until 2010. She invited 566 artists working in Berlin to realize works of sound art. The visitors in the gallery were given headsets with which to listen to the contributions.

For my contribution, I sampled a sequence from the Shepard scale, which creates the auditory illusion of a tone steadily descending in pitch, and replayed it several times over in a looped, closely spaced canon so that multiple tones were audible at the same time. On the DVD, the individual sequences are cued at equal intervals, beginning and ending one after another.
