The photograph Untitled (How House) shows the view from the How House’s garden through the window into the living room and, through it, to the adjacent terrace. The focus is on the building’s characteristic bilateral-diagonal roof and ceiling structure. The residence in Silver Lake, Los Angeles, was designed by Rudolph Schindler for James Eads How and completed in 1925.

The photograph serves as a kind of basso continuo for my work: the How House’s roof and ceiling structure was the nucleus of a key visual vocabulary in the development of various pieces, including the cube Interface No. 1 and the installation Webbing.
