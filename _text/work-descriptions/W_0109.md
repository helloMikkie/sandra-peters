The sculpture Untitled (Blaue Blume) was conceived in 2017 and grew out of the designs for the silkscreen prints on glass Untitled 1–6 (Slight Squint). For that series, I needed to select one of the eleven nets of the cube as a basic form. That necessity does not obtain when the three-dimensional cube itself, as opposed to a two-dimensional net, serves as the basic form. As in the silkscreen series, in Untitled (Blaue Blume), the eleven nets of the cube are laid out across the work’s faces, but in this instance, they are realized as cutouts. The cube’s stability as a sculpture is ensured by the fact that the eleven forms cut out of its faces and, in some instances, wrapped across its edges are placed such that their edges and vertices do not touch. The cutouts lend the cube the appearance of an architectural object with openings. The viewer can look into as well as through it. Given this perceptual blending of interior and exterior spaces, the sculpture lends itself to both indoor and outdoor presentation.
