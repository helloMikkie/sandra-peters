Tango is a site-sensitive installation. It consists of twenty-two transparent glass elements resting on the floor and the word “tango” spelled by wall-mounted neon letters glowing in a midnight blue. The glass elements are arranged in pairs. They are based on the eleven different nets of the cube; each pair consists of two identical nets. The eleven pairs are laid out across the room, underscoring the field-like quality of the ensemble.
